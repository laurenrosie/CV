## Lauren Watson

Having always gravitated towards problem solving and abstraction, I recently
graduated from Trinity College Dublin with a BA in Mathematics. I subsequently
decided to try coding in a new setting, somewhat removed from Mathematics and
Statistics (for the moment).

I have enrolled as a student at Makers Academy (a 16 week Software and Web
Development bootcamp) in order to pursue my interest in coding and improve the
quality of my programming practices.

I hope to find a position combining coding with statistics, data analytics or
mathematics.

## Education

## Experience

#### Mathematics Tutor, Just Maths Tutorial School, Templeogue (2012-2013)
- Taught all skill-levels and ages from 11-18
- Focused on Statistics, Algebra and Calculus

#### Volunteer Mathematics Tutor, Shanganagh Community Center (2011-2012)
- Taught Junior Certificate (GSCE level) Mathematics to underprivileged children

## Skills

#### Analytical Thinker

I have always enjoyed the analytical nature of problem solving and was fascinated
with mathematics from a young age. Having moved towards Statistical & Data Analytics
during my degree I realised the incredible potential when these skills are
combined with coding!

#### Communication of Technical Ideas
- Gained a lot of experience in the communication of technical ideas to non-technical decision makers
through my work with Trinity Student Managed Fund.
- My teaching experience taught me a vast amount about the communication of abstract ideas

#### Enjoy a fast-paced environment
- I love a challenge, and find I learn best and produce my best work when under
pressure and am in a fast-paced environment.

#### Resilience
- Despite being seriously ill, having major surgery and an aggressive schedule
of physiotherapy and medication during a period of over two years during my
degree, I still graduated with a grade and University experience I am proud of.
- Having now recovered, I find that while it was far from ideal, I actually
learned a huge amount about time management, working 'smart', prioritization and
resilience during this period.

#### Other Skills
- French speaker (DELF B2 Adulte)
- Experience with C, C++, Java and R.

## Interests
- Piano: I have played piano since the age of 6 and particularly love classical pieces.
- Reading: Varied topics from science fiction to classical literature to economics.
