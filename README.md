## Lauren Watson

Having always gravitated towards problem solving and abstraction, I recently
graduated from Trinity College Dublin with a First Class Honors in Mathematics and subsequently
decided to search for problem solving and abstraction in a new setting.

I have enrolled as a student at Makers Academy (a 16 week Software and Web Development bootcamp)
in order to pursue my interest in coding and improve the quality of my programming practices.

I hope to find a position combining coding with statistics, data analytics or mathematics.

- Taught Junior Certificate (GSCE level) Mathematics to underprivileged children

## Skills

#### Analytical Thinker

I have always enjoyed the analytical nature of problem solving and was fascinated
with mathematics from a young age. Having moved towards Statistical & Data Analytics
during my degree I realised the incredible potential when these skills are
combined with coding!


#### Communication of Technical Ideas
- Gained a lot of experience in the communication of technical ideas to non-technical decision makers
through my work with Trinity Student Managed Fund.
- My teaching experience taught me a vast amount about the communication of abstract ideas

#### Enjoy a fast-paced environment
- I love a challenge, and find I learn best and produce my best work when under
pressure and am in a fast-paced environment.

#### Other Skills
- Fluent French speaker (DELF B2 Adulte 78%)
- Experience with C, C++, Java and R.

## Interests
- Piano: I have played piano since the age of 6, attaining my final grade aged 16 and have since
continued to play classical pieces. I find it a brilliant way to relax!
- Reading: Always fearful of losing my command of English due to too much maths, I love
to read about varied topics from science fiction to classical literature to economics.
